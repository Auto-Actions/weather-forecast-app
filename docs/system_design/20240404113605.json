{"Implementation approach":"To address the project requirements efficiently, we will utilize Python with the Streamlit framework for the frontend, ensuring a user-friendly web application. For weather data, we will integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API, a reliable and widely used service. This approach allows us to focus on creating a minimalistic yet functional UI without the need for additional package installations beyond what's required for Streamlit and requests for API calls. The application will automatically detect the user's location or allow manual input for location-based weather forecasts.","File list":["app.py","weather_api.py","location_detector.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class App {\n        +StreamlitUI ui\n        +WeatherAPI weather_api\n        +LocationDetector location_detector\n        +run() void\n    }\n    class StreamlitUI {\n        +display_location_options(locations: list)\n        +display_weather_info(weather_info: dict)\n    }\n    class WeatherAPI {\n        +get_weather(location: str) dict\n    }\n    class LocationDetector {\n        +get_nearby_locations() list\n    }\n    App --> StreamlitUI\n    App --> WeatherAPI\n    App --> LocationDetector\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as App\n    participant UI as StreamlitUI\n    participant WAPI as WeatherAPI\n    participant LD as LocationDetector\n    A->>LD: get_nearby_locations()\n    LD-->>A: return locations\n    A->>UI: display_location_options(locations)\n    loop Select Location\n        UI->>A: selected_location\n    end\n    A->>WAPI: get_weather(selected_location)\n    WAPI-->>A: return weather_info\n    A->>UI: display_weather_info(weather_info)\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specifics of the OpenWeatherMap API integration, such as API key management and rate limits."}
