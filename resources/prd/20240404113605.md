## Requirement Analysis

The project requires integration with a 3rd party API for weather data, utilizing Python and Streamlit for development. It should be executable without additional package installations, focusing on user-friendliness and accuracy. Listing 5 nearby locations for user selection is crucial for personalized weather forecasts.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Integration with a reliable 3rd party weather API']
- ['P0', 'Streamlit-based UI for ease of use and deployment']
- ['P1', "Listing 5 nearby locations based on the user's current location or input"]
- ['P1', 'Ensuring the app runs without additional package installations']
- ['P2', 'Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface']

## UI Design draft

The app will feature a minimalist design with a focus on usability. The main screen will present a list of nearby locations, which the user can select to view the weather forecast. Weather details will be displayed in a clear, easy-to-read format, with icons representing different weather conditions.
