## Implementation approach

To address the project requirements efficiently, we will utilize Python with the Streamlit framework for the frontend, ensuring a user-friendly web application. For weather data, we will integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API, a reliable and widely used service. This approach allows us to focus on creating a minimalistic yet functional UI without the need for additional package installations beyond what's required for Streamlit and requests for API calls. The application will automatically detect the user's location or allow manual input for location-based weather forecasts.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class App {
        +StreamlitUI ui
        +WeatherAPI weather_api
        +LocationDetector location_detector
        +run() void
    }
    class StreamlitUI {
        +display_location_options(locations: list)
        +display_weather_info(weather_info: dict)
    }
    class WeatherAPI {
        +get_weather(location: str) dict
    }
    class LocationDetector {
        +get_nearby_locations() list
    }
    App --> StreamlitUI
    App --> WeatherAPI
    App --> LocationDetector


## Program call flow

    participant A as App
    participant UI as StreamlitUI
    participant WAPI as WeatherAPI
    participant LD as LocationDetector
    A->>LD: get_nearby_locations()
    LD-->>A: return locations
    A->>UI: display_location_options(locations)
    loop Select Location
        UI->>A: selected_location
    end
    A->>WAPI: get_weather(selected_location)
    WAPI-->>A: return weather_info
    A->>UI: display_weather_info(weather_info)


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specifics of the OpenWeatherMap API integration, such as API key management and rate limits.
